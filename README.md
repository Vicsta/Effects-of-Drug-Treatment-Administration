Using several of the MIMIC 3 Datasets, we aim to analyze the correlation between drug treatment administration and deaths, under the hypothesis that drugs are often not administered properly, whether it be by a patient's volition to not adhere to a prescribed treatment, or the under or over dosing of patients in treating certain maladities. Here, we use pneumonia as our main diagnosis baseline, as well as taking a look at sepsis for diagnoses that are more fatal.

Our initlal hypothesis: Medical treatment for patients is a risk just as much as it is a reward. Patients recieving medical treatment are at a greater risk of death, not just because of the serverity of the ailment, but from imperfect administrations.
